On 	1
an 	1
exceptionally 	1
hot 	1
evening 	1
early 	1
in 	1
July 	1
a 	1
young 	1
man 	1
came 	1
out 	1
of 	1
the 	1
garret 	1
in 	1
which 	1
he 	1
lodged 	1
in 	1
S. 	1
Place 	1
and 	1
walked 	1
slowly, 	1
as 	1
though 	1
in 	1
hesitation, 	1
towards 	1
K. 	1
bridge. 	1
He 	1
had 	1
successfully 	1
avoided 	1
meeting 	1
his 	1
landlady 	1
on 	1
the 	1
staircase. 	1
His 	1
garret 	1
was 	1
under 	1
the 	1
roof 	1
of 	1
a 	1
high, 	1
five-storied 	1
house 	1
and 	1
was 	1
more 	1
like 	1
a 	1
cupboard 	1
than 	1
a 	1
room. 	1
The 	1
landlady 	1
who 	1
provided 	1
him 	1
with 	1
garret, 	1
dinners, 	1
and 	1
attendance, 	1
lived 	1
on 	1
the 	1
floor 	1
below, 	1
and 	1
every 	1
time 	1
he 	1
went 	1
out 	1
he 	1
was 	1
obliged 	1
to 	1
pass 	1
her 	1
kitchen, 	1
the 	1
door 	1
of 	1
which 	1
invariably 	1
stood 	1
open. 	1
And 	1
each 	1
time 	1
he 	1
passed, 	1
the 	1
young 	1
man 	1
had 	1
a 	1
sick, 	1
frightened 	1
feeling, 	1
which 	1
made 	1
him 	1
scowl 	1
and 	1
feel 	1
ashamed. 	1
He 	1
was 	1
hopelessly 	1
in 	1
debt 	1
to 	1
his 	1
landlady, 	1
and 	1
was 	1
afraid 	1
of 	1
meeting 	1
her. 	1
This 	1
was 	1
not 	1
because 	1
he 	1
was 	1
cowardly 	1
and 	1
abject, 	1
quite 	1
the 	1
contrary; 	1
but 	1
for 	1
some 	1
time 	1
past 	1
he 	1
had 	1
been 	1
in 	1
an 	1
overstrained 	1
irritable 	1
condition, 	1
verging 	1
on 	1
hypochondria. 	1
He 	1
had 	1
become 	1
so 	1
completely 	1
absorbed 	1
in 	1
himself, 	1
and 	1
isolated 	1
from 	1
his 	1
fellows 	1
that 	1
he 	1
dreaded 	1
meeting, 	1
not 	1
only 	1
his 	1
landlady, 	1
but 	1
anyone 	1
at 	1
all. 	1
He 	1
was 	1
crushed 	1
by 	1
poverty, 	1
but 	1
the 	1
anxieties 	1
of 	1
his 	1
position 	1
had 	1
of 	1
late 	1
ceased 	1
to 	1
weigh 	1
upon 	1
him. 	1
He 	1
had 	1
given 	1
up 	1
attending 	1
to 	1
matters 	1
of 	1
practical 	1
importance; 	1
he 	1
had 	1
lost 	1
all 	1
desire 	1
to 	1
do 	1
so. 	1
Nothing 	1
that 	1
any 	1
landlady 	1
could 	1
do 	1
had 	1
a 	1
real 	1
terror 	1
for 	1
him. 	1
But 	1
to 	1
be 	1
stopped 	1
on 	1
the 	1
stairs, 	1
to 	1
be 	1
forced 	1
to 	1
listen 	1
to 	1
her 	1
trivial, 	1
irrelevant 	1
gossip, 	1
to 	1
pestering 	1
demands 	1
for 	1
payment, 	1
threats 	1
and 	1
complaints, 	1
and 	1
to 	1
rack 	1
his 	1
brains 	1
for 	1
excuses, 	1
to 	1
prevaricate, 	1
to 	1
lie—no, 	1
rather 	1
than 	1
that, 	1
he 	1
would 	1
creep 	1
down 	1
the 	1
stairs 	1
like 	1
a 	1
cat 	1
and 	1
slip 	1
out 	1
unseen. 	1
This 	1
evening, 	1
however, 	1
on 	1
coming 	1
out 	1
into 	1
the 	1
street, 	1
he 	1
became 	1
acutely 	1
aware 	1
of 	1
his 	1
fears. 	1
“I 	1
want 	1
to 	1
attempt 	1
a 	1
thing 	1
like 	1
that 	1
and 	1
am 	1
frightened 	1
by 	1
these 	1
trifles,” 	1
he 	1
thought, 	1
with 	1
an 	1
odd 	1
smile. 	1
“Hm... 	1
yes, 	1
all 	1
is 	1
in 	1
a 	1
man’s 	1
hands 	1
and 	1
he 	1
lets 	1
it 	1
all 	1
slip 	1
from 	1
cowardice, 	1
that’s 	1
an 	1
axiom. 	1
It 	1
would 	1
be 	1
interesting 	1
to 	1
know 	1
what 	1
it 	1
is 	1
men 	1
are 	1
most 	1
afraid 	1
of. 	1
Taking 	1
a 	1
new 	1
step, 	1
uttering 	1
a 	1
new 	1
word 	1
is 	1
what 	1
they 	1
fear 	1
most.... 	1
But 	1
I 	1
am 	1
talking 	1
too 	1
much. 	1
It’s 	1
because 	1
I 	1
chatter 	1
that 	1
I 	1
do 	1
nothing. 	1
Or 	1
perhaps 	1
it 	1
is 	1
that 	1
I 	1
chatter 	1
because 	1
I 	1
do 	1
nothing. 	1
I’ve 	1
learned 	1
to 	1
chatter 	1
this 	1
last 	1
month, 	1
lying 	1
for 	1
days 	1
together 	1
in 	1
my 	1
den 	1
thinking... 	1
of 	1
Jack 	1
the 	1
Giant-killer. 	1
Why 	1
am 	1
I 	1
going 	1
there 	1
now? 	1
Am 	1
I 	1
capable 	1
of 	1
that? 	1
Is 	1
that 	1
serious? 	1
It 	1
is 	1
not 	1
serious 	1
at 	1
all. 	1
It’s 	1
simply 	1
a 	1
fantasy 	1
to 	1
amuse 	1
myself; 	1
a 	1
plaything! 	1
Yes, 	1
maybe 	1
it 	1
is 	1
a 	1
plaything.” 	1
