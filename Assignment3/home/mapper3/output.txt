He 	1
had 	1
not 	1
far 	1
to 	1
go; 	1
he 	1
knew 	1
indeed 	1
how 	1
many 	1
steps 	1
it 	1
was 	1
from 	1
the 	1
gate 	1
of 	1
his 	1
lodging 	1
house: 	1
exactly 	1
seven 	1
hundred 	1
and 	1
thirty. 	1
He 	1
had 	1
counted 	1
them 	1
once 	1
when 	1
he 	1
had 	1
been 	1
lost 	1
in 	1
dreams. 	1
At 	1
the 	1
time 	1
he 	1
had 	1
put 	1
no 	1
faith 	1
in 	1
those 	1
dreams 	1
and 	1
was 	1
only 	1
tantalising 	1
himself 	1
by 	1
their 	1
hideous 	1
but 	1
daring 	1
recklessness. 	1
Now, 	1
a 	1
month 	1
later, 	1
he 	1
had 	1
begun 	1
to 	1
look 	1
upon 	1
them 	1
differently, 	1
and, 	1
in 	1
spite 	1
of 	1
the 	1
monologues 	1
in 	1
which 	1
he 	1
jeered 	1
at 	1
his 	1
own 	1
impotence 	1
and 	1
indecision, 	1
he 	1
had 	1
involuntarily 	1
come 	1
to 	1
regard 	1
this 	1
“hideous” 	1
dream 	1
as 	1
an 	1
exploit 	1
to 	1
be 	1
attempted, 	1
although 	1
he 	1
still 	1
did 	1
not 	1
realise 	1
this 	1
himself. 	1
He 	1
was 	1
positively 	1
going 	1
now 	1
for 	1
a 	1
“rehearsal” 	1
of 	1
his 	1
project, 	1
and 	1
at 	1
every 	1
step 	1
his 	1
excitement 	1
grew 	1
more 	1
and 	1
more 	1
violent.With 	1
a 	1
sinking 	1
heart 	1
and 	1
a 	1
nervous 	1
tremor, 	1
he 	1
went 	1
up 	1
to 	1
a 	1
huge 	1
house 	1
which 	1
on 	1
one 	1
side 	1
looked 	1
on 	1
to 	1
the 	1
canal, 	1
and 	1
on 	1
the 	1
other 	1
into 	1
the 	1
street. 	1
This 	1
house 	1
was 	1
let 	1
out 	1
in 	1
tiny 	1
tenements 	1
and 	1
was 	1
inhabited 	1
by 	1
working 	1
people 	1
of 	1
all 	1
kinds—tailors, 	1
locksmiths, 	1
cooks, 	1
Germans 	1
of 	1
sorts, 	1
girls 	1
picking 	1
up 	1
a 	1
living 	1
as 	1
best 	1
they 	1
could, 	1
petty 	1
clerks, 	1
etc. 	1
There 	1
was 	1
a 	1
continual 	1
coming 	1
and 	1
going 	1
through 	1
the 	1
two 	1
gates 	1
and 	1
in 	1
the 	1
two 	1
courtyards 	1
of 	1
the 	1
house. 	1
Three 	1
or 	1
four 	1
door-keepers 	1
were 	1
employed 	1
on 	1
the 	1
building. 	1
The 	1
young 	1
man 	1
was 	1
very 	1
glad 	1
to 	1
meet 	1
none 	1
of 	1
them, 	1
and 	1
at 	1
once 	1
slipped 	1
unnoticed 	1
through 	1
the 	1
door 	1
on 	1
the 	1
right, 	1
and 	1
up 	1
the 	1
staircase. 	1
It 	1
was 	1
a 	1
back 	1
staircase, 	1
dark 	1
and 	1
narrow, 	1
but 	1
he 	1
was 	1
familiar 	1
with 	1
it 	1
already, 	1
and 	1
knew 	1
his 	1
way, 	1
and 	1
he 	1
liked 	1
all 	1
these 	1
surroundings: 	1
in 	1
such 	1
darkness 	1
even 	1
the 	1
most 	1
inquisitive 	1
eyes 	1
were 	1
not 	1
to 	1
be 	1
dreaded. 	1
“If 	1
I 	1
am 	1
so 	1
scared 	1
now, 	1
what 	1
would 	1
it 	1
be 	1
if 	1
it 	1
somehow 	1
came 	1
to 	1
pass 	1
that 	1
I 	1
were 	1
really 	1
going 	1
to 	1
do 	1
it?” 	1
he 	1
could 	1
not 	1
help 	1
asking 	1
himself 	1
as 	1
he 	1
reached 	1
the 	1
fourth 	1
storey. 	1
There 	1
his 	1
progress 	1
was 	1
barred 	1
by 	1
some 	1
porters 	1
who 	1
were 	1
engaged 	1
in 	1
moving 	1
furniture 	1
out 	1
of 	1
a 	1
flat. 	1
He 	1
knew 	1
that 	1
the 	1
flat 	1
had 	1
been 	1
occupied 	1
by 	1
a 	1
German 	1
clerk 	1
in 	1
the 	1
civil 	1
service, 	1
and 	1
his 	1
family. 	1
This 	1
German 	1
was 	1
moving 	1
out 	1
then, 	1
and 	1
so 	1
the 	1
fourth 	1
floor 	1
on 	1
this 	1
staircase 	1
would 	1
be 	1
untenanted 	1
except 	1
by 	1
the 	1
old 	1
woman. 	1
“That’s 	1
a 	1
good 	1
thing 	1
anyway,” 	1
he 	1
thought 	1
to 	1
himself, 	1
as 	1
he 	1
rang 	1
the 	1
bell 	1
of 	1
the 	1
old 	1
woman’s 	1
flat. 	1
The 	1
bell 	1
gave 	1
a 	1
faint 	1
tinkle 	1
as 	1
though 	1
it 	1
were 	1
made 	1
of 	1
tin 	1
and 	1
not 	1
of 	1
copper. 	1
The 	1
little 	1
flats 	1
in 	1
such 	1
houses 	1
always 	1
have 	1
bells 	1
that 	1
ring 	1
like 	1
that. 	1
He 	1
had 	1
forgotten 	1
the 	1
note 	1
of 	1
that 	1
bell, 	1
and 	1
now 	1
its 	1
peculiar 	1
tinkle 	1
seemed 	1
to 	1
remind 	1
him 	1
of 	1
something 	1
and 	1
to 	1
bring 	1
it 	1
clearly 	1
before 	1
him.... 	1
He 	1
started, 	1
his 	1
nerves 	1
were 	1
terribly 	1
overstrained 	1
by 	1
now. 	1
In 	1
a 	1
little 	1
while, 	1
the 	1
door 	1
was 	1
opened 	1
a 	1
tiny 	1
crack: 	1
the 	1
old 	1
woman 	1
eyed 	1
her 	1
visitor 	1
with 	1
evident 	1
distrust 	1
through 	1
the 	1
crack, 	1
and 	1
nothing 	1
could 	1
be 	1
seen 	1
but 	1
her 	1
little 	1
eyes, 	1
glittering 	1
in 	1
the 	1
darkness. 	1
But, 	1
seeing 	1
a 	1
number 	1
of 	1
people 	1
on 	1
the 	1
landing, 	1
she 	1
grew 	1
bolder, 	1
and 	1
opened 	1
the 	1
door 	1
wide. 	1
The 	1
young 	1
man 	1
stepped 	1
into 	1
the 	1
dark 	1
entry, 	1
which 	1
was 	1
partitioned 	1
off 	1
from 	1
the 	1
tiny 	1
kitchen. 	1
The 	1
old 	1
woman 	1
stood 	1
facing 	1
him 	1
in 	1
silence 	1
and 	1
looking 	1
inquiringly 	1
at 	1
him. 	1
She 	1
was 	1
a 	1
diminutive, 	1
withered 	1
up 	1
old 	1
woman 	1
of 	1
sixty, 	1
with 	1
sharp 	1
malignant 	1
eyes 	1
and 	1
a 	1
sharp 	1
little 	1
nose. 	1
Her 	1
colourless, 	1
somewhat 	1
grizzled 	1
hair 	1
was 	1
thickly 	1
smeared 	1
with 	1
oil, 	1
and 	1
she 	1
wore 	1
no 	1
kerchief 	1
over 	1
it. 	1
Round 	1
her 	1
thin 	1
long 	1
neck, 	1
which 	1
looked 	1
like 	1
a 	1
hen’s 	1
leg, 	1
was 	1
knotted 	1
some 	1
sort 	1
of 	1
flannel 	1
rag, 	1
and, 	1
in 	1
spite 	1
of 	1
the 	1
heat, 	1
there 	1
hung 	1
flapping 	1
on 	1
her 	1
shoulders, 	1
a 	1
mangy 	1
fur 	1
cape, 	1
yellow 	1
with 	1
age. 	1
The 	1
old 	1
woman 	1
coughed 	1
and 	1
groaned 	1
at 	1
every 	1
instant. 	1
The 	1
young 	1
man 	1
must 	1
have 	1
looked 	1
at 	1
her 	1
with 	1
a 	1
rather 	1
peculiar 	1
expression, 	1
for 	1
a 	1
gleam 	1
of 	1
mistrust 	1
came 	1
into 	1
her 	1
eyes 	1
again. 	1
