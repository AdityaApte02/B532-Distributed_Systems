The 	1
heat 	1
in 	1
the 	1
street 	1
was 	1
terrible 	1
and 	1
the 	1
airlessness 	1
the 	1
bustle 	1
and 	1
the 	1
plaster 	1
scaffolding 	1
bricks 	1
and 	1
dust 	1
all 	1
about 	1
him 	1
and 	1
that 	1
special 	1
Petersburg 	1
stench 	1
so 	1
familiar 	1
to 	1
all 	1
who 	1
are 	1
unable 	1
to 	1
get 	1
out 	1
of 	1
town 	1
in 	1
summerâall 	1
worked 	1
painfully 	1
upon 	1
the 	1
young 	1
manâs 	1
already 	1
overwrought 	1
nerves 	1
The 	1
insufferable 	1
stench 	1
from 	1
the 	1
pothouses 	1
which 	1
are 	1
particularly 	1
numerous 	1
in 	1
that 	1
part 	1
of 	1
the 	1
town 	1
and 	1
the 	1
drunken 	1
men 	1
whom 	1
he 	1
met 	1
continually 	1
although 	1
it 	1
was 	1
a 	1
working 	1
day 	1
completed 	1
the 	1
revolting 	1
misery 	1
of 	1
the 	1
picture 	1
An 	1
expression 	1
of 	1
the 	1
profoundest 	1
disgust 	1
gleamed 	1
for 	1
a 	1
moment 	1
in 	1
the 	1
young 	1
manâs 	1
refined 	1
face 	1
He 	1
was 	1
by 	1
the 	1
way 	1
exceptionally 	1
handsome 	1
above 	1
the 	1
average 	1
in 	1
height 	1
slim 	1
wellbuilt 	1
with 	1
beautiful 	1
dark 	1
eyes 	1
and 	1
dark 	1
brown 	1
hair 	1
Soon 	1
he 	1
sank 	1
into 	1
deep 	1
thought 	1
or 	1
more 	1
accurately 	1
speaking 	1
into 	1
a 	1
complete 	1
blankness 	1
of 	1
mind 	1
he 	1
walked 	1
along 	1
not 	1
observing 	1
what 	1
was 	1
about 	1
him 	1
and 	1
not 	1
caring 	1
to 	1
observe 	1
it 	1
From 	1
time 	1
to 	1
time 	1
he 	1
would 	1
mutter 	1
something 	1
from 	1
the 	1
habit 	1
of 	1
talking 	1
to 	1
himself 	1
to 	1
which 	1
he 	1
had 	1
just 	1
confessed 	1
At 	1
these 	1
moments 	1
he 	1
would 	1
become 	1
conscious 	1
that 	1
his 	1
ideas 	1
were 	1
sometimes 	1
in 	1
a 	1
tangle 	1
and 	1
that 	1
he 	1
was 	1
very 	1
weak 	1
for 	1
two 	1
days 	1
he 	1
had 	1
scarcely 	1
tasted 	1
food 	1
 	1
He 	1
was 	1
so 	1
badly 	1
dressed 	1
that 	1
even 	1
a 	1
man 	1
accustomed 	1
to 	1
shabbiness 	1
would 	1
have 	1
been 	1
ashamed 	1
to 	1
be 	1
seen 	1
in 	1
the 	1
street 	1
in 	1
such 	1
rags 	1
In 	1
that 	1
quarter 	1
of 	1
the 	1
town 	1
however 	1
scarcely 	1
any 	1
shortcoming 	1
in 	1
dress 	1
would 	1
have 	1
created 	1
surprise 	1
Owing 	1
to 	1
the 	1
proximity 	1
of 	1
the 	1
Hay 	1
Market 	1
the 	1
number 	1
of 	1
establishments 	1
of 	1
bad 	1
character 	1
the 	1
preponderance 	1
of 	1
the 	1
trading 	1
and 	1
working 	1
class 	1
population 	1
crowded 	1
in 	1
these 	1
streets 	1
and 	1
alleys 	1
in 	1
the 	1
heart 	1
of 	1
Petersburg 	1
types 	1
so 	1
various 	1
were 	1
to 	1
be 	1
seen 	1
in 	1
the 	1
streets 	1
that 	1
no 	1
figure 	1
however 	1
queer 	1
would 	1
have 	1
caused 	1
surprise 	1
But 	1
there 	1
was 	1
such 	1
accumulated 	1
bitterness 	1
and 	1
contempt 	1
in 	1
the 	1
young 	1
manâs 	1
heart 	1
that 	1
in 	1
spite 	1
of 	1
all 	1
the 	1
fastidiousness 	1
of 	1
youth 	1
he 	1
minded 	1
his 	1
rags 	1
least 	1
of 	1
all 	1
in 	1
the 	1
street 	1
It 	1
was 	1
a 	1
different 	1
matter 	1
when 	1
he 	1
met 	1
with 	1
acquaintances 	1
or 	1
with 	1
former 	1
fellow 	1
students 	1
whom 	1
indeed 	1
he 	1
disliked 	1
meeting 	1
at 	1
any 	1
time 	1
And 	1
yet 	1
when 	1
a 	1
drunken 	1
man 	1
who 	1
for 	1
some 	1
unknown 	1
reason 	1
was 	1
being 	1
taken 	1
somewhere 	1
in 	1
a 	1
huge 	1
waggon 	1
dragged 	1
by 	1
a 	1
heavy 	1
dray 	1
horse 	1
suddenly 	1
shouted 	1
at 	1
him 	1
as 	1
he 	1
drove 	1
past 	1
âœHey 	1
there 	1
German 	1
hatterâ 	1
bawling 	1
at 	1
the 	1
top 	1
of 	1
his 	1
voice 	1
and 	1
pointing 	1
at 	1
himâthe 	1
young 	1
man 	1
stopped 	1
suddenly 	1
and 	1
clutched 	1
tremulously 	1
at 	1
his 	1
hat 	1
It 	1
was 	1
a 	1
tall 	1
round 	1
hat 	1
from 	1
Zimmermanâs 	1
but 	1
completely 	1
worn 	1
out 	1
rusty 	1
with 	1
age 	1
all 	1
torn 	1
and 	1
bespattered 	1
brimless 	1
and 	1
bent 	1
on 	1
one 	1
side 	1
in 	1
a 	1
most 	1
unseemly 	1
fashion 	1
Not 	1
shame 	1
however 	1
but 	1
quite 	1
another 	1
feeling 	1
akin 	1
to 	1
terror 	1
had 	1
overtaken 	1
him 	1
âœI 	1
knew 	1
itâ 	1
he 	1
muttered 	1
in 	1
confusion 	1
âœI 	1
thought 	1
so 	1
Thatâs 	1
the 	1
worst 	1
of 	1
all 	1
Why 	1
a 	1
stupid 	1
thing 	1
like 	1
this 	1
the 	1
most 	1
trivial 	1
detail 	1
might 	1
spoil 	1
the 	1
whole 	1
plan 	1
Yes 	1
my 	1
hat 	1
is 	1
too 	1
noticeable 	1
It 	1
looks 	1
absurd 	1
and 	1
that 	1
makes 	1
it 	1
noticeable 	1
With 	1
my 	1
rags 	1
I 	1
ought 	1
to 	1
wear 	1
a 	1
cap 	1
any 	1
sort 	1
of 	1
old 	1
pancake 	1
but 	1
not 	1
this 	1
grotesque 	1
thing 	1
Nobody 	1
wears 	1
such 	1
a 	1
hat 	1
it 	1
would 	1
be 	1
noticed 	1
a 	1
mile 	1
off 	1
it 	1
would 	1
be 	1
remembered 	1
What 	1
matters 	1
is 	1
that 	1
people 	1
would 	1
remember 	1
it 	1
and 	1
that 	1
would 	1
give 	1
them 	1
a 	1
clue 	1
For 	1
this 	1
business 	1
one 	1
should 	1
be 	1
as 	1
little 	1
conspicuous 	1
as 	1
possible 	1
Trifles 	1
trifles 	1
are 	1
what 	1
matter 	1
Why 	1
itâs 	1
just 	1
such 	1
trifles 	1
that 	1
always 	1
ruin 	1
everythingâ 	1
